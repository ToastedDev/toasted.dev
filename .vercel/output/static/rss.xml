Here&apos;s the full story.</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On June 7th at 2:34 PM UTC, my YouTube channel with over 14,000 subscribers was terminated off of the platform. Why? Because of &quot;circumvention of a ban&quot;. But to understand why this happened, we need to rewind back in time a bit...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 0: Important Info&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start, if you&apos;re reading this as a fan of Graphify, please make sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/@MinMaxStats&quot;&gt;subscribe to MinMax&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s our new channel. We had to rebrand to avoid this situation happening again. Hopefully it doesn&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1: The First Termination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in December 16th, 2022, when I only had 1.2K subscribers, I was a naive little child. I trusted anyone with my YouTube channel, and allowed them to stream on my channel. This one mistake caused the outcome that would later change the course of my YouTube career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few days prior, I had hired a new stream host. Their name was ZyboStats. Little did I know that this was actually an alias for two community members working together to target my channel and others like it, Ummerate Madness and Theolikee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the name &quot;Theolikee&quot; already gives off shivers to the stats community, but if you&apos;re not shaking in your chair already, let me explain who he is. &lt;strong&gt;Theolikee&lt;/strong&gt;, better known as just &lt;strong&gt;Theo&lt;/strong&gt; (no not &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/@t3dotgg&quot;&gt;Theo Browne&lt;/a&gt;, he&apos;s cool), or Lily, had a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; of a reputation in the community for targeting people&apos;s channels, tricking them into letting him stream on their channel, and then playing TOS-breraking content on their channels (for moral reasons I shall not state exactly what it is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was just one of many targets. And they had tricked me successfully. Ummerate started streaming on my channel just as normal, and I went to bed because it was getting late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was when they struck. They started playing inappropriate content on my stream, and mass-reporting the stream to get the channel banned. Everybody was freaking out, my moderators, the viewers, literally everyone. And I was just sleeping, dreaming about what to do when I wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I woke up, I was in shock. My channel with 1.2K subscribers was terminated. I didn&apos;t even know what to say. I just stood there, on my Discord client, just staring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&apos;t give up, I made a new channel and started grinding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 2: The Rise (again)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after I created the new channel, I started posting videos, making livestreams, all that fun jazz. The channel would grow slowly until what I will now call the &quot;K-Pop Incident&quot; happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, one of the BLACKPINK members was about to drop a single, and I was like &quot;oh this could get me some views,&quot; so I started streaming the statistics. And oh boy did it get views. If I remember correctly it got like... 3K viewers at peak? I don&apos;t know, I can&apos;t check anymore. And I gained a little over 6K from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I started streaming MrBeast vs SET India. It got decent views I guess, and it got me to around 8K subscribers. And then a few months after I streamed MrBeast vs T-Series (which would become my longest stream ever, at over 2,025 hours), but during 200M the stream got over &lt;strong&gt;600 viewers&lt;/strong&gt;! Not the 3K it had during the K-Pop Incident, but still a lot for my channel! And of course, with this amount of viewership, a lot of them subscribed, and with that boost it pushed me over to 10K subscribers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued streaming and kept gaining subscribers! But this was when the tides started to turn...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 3: The First Signs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 22nd, 2024 (yes it was during &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/dear-matheus&quot;&gt;the Matheus incident&lt;/a&gt;), Graphify+ (our second channel) and Archiveify (our archive channel) was terminated on YouTube. The reason stated in the emails and on the channel pages was &quot;violation of the Terms of Service,&quot; with no actual clarification on what rule we broke. After we &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/GraphifyStudios/status/1770782181180182946&quot;&gt;asked TeamYouTube on Twitter (cough, sorry, X)&lt;/a&gt;, they said it was because of &quot;circumvention of a ban.&quot; Very weird, but we assumed it was because of the previous termination and moved on with our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until we realized we couldn&apos;t access the main channel. This was because, in the naiveness that I had, I made the Graphify+ channel part of the actual Google account instead of as a brand account, and since Graphify+ was terminated, they wouldn&apos;t let me access any of my channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hey at least we could get one of my managers to give me access to the channel, and THEN we can move on with our lives. But of course, Matheus (who was a Manager at the time) had to make this harder and basically held the channel hostage. But more about that &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/dear-matheus#chapter-5-holding-graphify-hostage&quot;&gt;in my other blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, Graphify Shorts was also banned. Still the same &quot;violation of Terms of Service&quot; vague reasoning, but we all assumed it was the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this meant something. This meant that the main Graphify channel could also get banned, and that&apos;s exactly what they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 4: The End&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 7th, 2024 at 2:34 PM UTC, Graphify was terminated from YouTube for &quot;violating the Terms of Service.&quot; It finally got to the main channel. The channel had 13.9K subscribers before it was terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my friends told me that the channel got terminated I denied it, thinking that they were just pranking me (not uncommon when you&apos;re friends with Matheus). Turns out, they weren&apos;t. When I went to go to the channel, it was gone. I just stood there, on the YouTube 404 page. I didn&apos;t know what to say or think, so I just stood there looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was insanely sad for me. I worked so hard on this channel to get it to where it is now, just for YouTube to terminate it because of the first channel being hacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&apos;t mention this either but I actually got monetized on Graphify, but we had some ID issues so it was paused for a bit. We never got it resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 5: The Aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&apos;t give up. I made another channel (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/@MinMaxStats&quot;&gt;subscribe btw&lt;/a&gt;) and started grinding again. I restarted my 24/7 livestream, re-edited my last timelapse and posted it onto the channel. And that&apos;s where we are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, my friend, Graphify team member, and member of the MrBeast Stats crew, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/charlieashfordd&quot;&gt;Charlie&lt;/a&gt; (you might remember him from the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/dear-matheus&quot;&gt;Matheus incident&lt;/a&gt;, he helped out a lot with that), talked with YouTube Support about the terminated 14K subscriber channel and the 1K channel. They told us to fill out a form of what happened to the 1K channel and said to wait at least 3 working days for a response. As of writing this, we have not recieved a response. I&apos;ll update this blog post when we do, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we wrap up, I&apos;d like to say thanks to everyone for joining the #SaveGraphify movement and tweeting #FreeGraphify, along with also subscribing to the new channel. We got to over 122 subscribers in only 24 hours after we released the new channel. The support you guys give really means a lot to me. Back when my first channel with only around 90 subscribers got terminated (that is it&apos;s own separate can of worms that we won&apos;t get into), I had no one to help me or support me. I just had to rebuild my channel from scratch, without anyone there to help or support me, or even promote the channel. So thanks everyone &amp;lt;3.&lt;/p&gt;

Apparently Matheus would.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday as I write this, on March 21st, my friend (or, well, ex-friend) &lt;strong&gt;Matheusify&lt;/strong&gt;, who we&apos;ll refer to as &lt;strong&gt;Matheus&lt;/strong&gt; from now on, blackmailed and threatened me just because I didn&apos;t want to tell him a secret of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post delves into the deep delusion that Matheus has gone through. From the initial incident, to the reaction, to the apology, we&apos;ve got it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UPDATE (03/23/2024)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few hours after this blog post&apos;s release, Matheus decided to &quot;take a break from Discord.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/update-1-taking-a-break.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus&apos; profile, with his display name set to &amp;quot;Taking a Break.&amp;quot; and his profile picture being slightly darker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also took a break from YouTube. But not before he commented on my community post about this blog post saying that it&apos;s &quot;all lies&quot; and it&apos;s just &quot;fake bs that [I] made to ruin [his] image.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/update-1-lies.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying that the post is all lies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought &lt;a href=&quot;#chapter-6-he-gives-up&quot;&gt;you were sorry for doing all of this&lt;/a&gt;, but now you&apos;re saying I&apos;m lying? Also I thought you said this was a character that you played? Oh well, I guess all of that gets thrown out the window once you actually get exposed in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I saw this coming. &lt;a href=&quot;#its-all-lies&quot;&gt;He did say he would do this&lt;/a&gt;, so I&apos;m not surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UPDATE (03/24/2024)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day that I made &lt;a href=&quot;#update-03232024&quot;&gt;that last update&lt;/a&gt;, he came back on Discord. That was a short break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/update-2-comeback.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus&apos; profile, showing that it is back to normal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he came back, he decided to take things up a notch. He brought back the &lt;a href=&quot;#red-profile&quot;&gt;infamous red profile and angry character&lt;/a&gt; from the initial incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/update-2-evilify.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus&apos; profile, with his display name set as &amp;quot;Evilify&amp;quot;, with the same red profile picture from the incident&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then started posting screenshots of something private with him and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/@TERA_TV&quot;&gt;TERA&lt;/a&gt; (which I won&apos;t include here for his own privacy) and started using that as blackmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/update-2-blackmail.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying &amp;quot;did you really think I wouldn&apos;t [screenshot] that to use as blackmail&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also told me to kill myself in his about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/update-2-kys.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus&apos; profile, showing his about me that says &amp;quot;Kys toast&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was so much more, but I can&apos;t include it all in this update, otherwise just this update alone would be a 10 minute read. Though I&apos;m considering making this a separate blog post, as this whole situation is its own can of worms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, he did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxWKCH9PzwZElvSxi9sj4XPHYiiIRuuVc-&quot;&gt;actually apologize on his community tab on his YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. That&apos;s something!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/update-2-apology.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of Matheus&apos; apology on his community tab on YouTube&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, I still do not accept this apology. Unless I see actual change in Matheus, I&apos;m not going to accept him as my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into this, I&apos;d like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/@Stats100&quot;&gt;Galvin/Stats100&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/charlieashfordd&quot;&gt;Charlie from the MrBeast Stats crew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/@GNZGUY&quot;&gt;GNZGUY&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/@DarioCounts&quot;&gt;Dario&lt;/a&gt; for helping me get all of the evidence for this. It&apos;s pretty hard to get evidence from a group chat you were kicked out of just because you didn&apos;t want to tell someone a secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1: The Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before the incident, I had a huge mental and physical breakdown. Yes I was physically crying (this will be important later). This was because I did something that I currently do not want to disclose due to privacy reasons. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/@ChoccyStatistics&quot;&gt;Choccy&lt;/a&gt; and Galvin were trying to comfort me, and I was feeling better. I even told Galvin what had happened because I trust him to keep it between the two of us (don&apos;t ask him to tell you though). Everything seemed to be going well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Matheus entered the chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 2: It Begins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matheus immediately joins the chat by asking me to tell him the secret too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/tell-me-also-in-dms-you-yab.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus asking me to &amp;quot;tell [him] also in DMs you YAB&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told him I didn&apos;t want to tell him because it was something I didn&apos;t want anyone to know, and Matheus has had a track record of leaking my secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/begging-to-know.png&quot; alt=&quot;A back-and-forth between me and Matheus talking about how I don&apos;t want him to know&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/i-am-more-mature.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus telling me that he has changed and that he won&apos;t do it again&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems tame so far, but it only gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 2.2: The Blackmail Starts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I didn&apos;t respond for a few minutes, he decided to hit me and the rest of the group members with a bombshell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/if-you-tell-me-i-gonna-stop-hating-on-yabc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus telling me &amp;quot;if you tell me I gonna stop hating on yabc&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the blackmail and threats begin. He starts tame by saying that he&apos;ll stop hating on &lt;a href=&quot;https://yabcounts.com&quot;&gt;YAB ?! Counts&lt;/a&gt; if I tell him. I told him to &quot;please stop,&quot; because I was literally crying on my table reading these messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/please-stop.png&quot; alt=&quot;Me telling Matheus to stop because I was criyng&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does he stop? Of course not, he doubles down!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/doubling-down-on-hating-on-yabc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus asking me &amp;quot;do you want me to continue hating on yabc?&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I&apos;m just screaming and begging him to stop, but he triples down and says that he doesn&apos;t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/i-do-not-care.png&quot; alt=&quot;Me begging Matheus to stop, and Matheus saying he doesn&apos;t care&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by this point, Galvin was already telling him to stop, because this was getting way too out of hand. But he quadrouples down, saying that he&apos;s &quot;a narcissist after all&quot; and that he &quot;cares more about [himself] than [the] well being of others&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/im-a-narcissist.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying that he&apos;s a narcissist&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then he quintuples down (that&apos;s a word I haven&apos;t heard of until writing this) by agreeing to what I said about him blackmailing me over the biggest secret of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/matheus-admitting-to-blackmailing-me.png&quot; alt=&quot;Me saying that I &amp;quot;can&apos;t believe Matheus is trying to blackmail me over my biggest secret&amp;quot;, and Matheus agreeing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Matheus tells me that he could &quot;end my 2 streams if [he] feels like it,&quot; which to me sounds like a threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/i-can-end-your-2-streams.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus threatening to end my 2 streams&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s where I drew the line, and I blocked him and removed his access from Graphify, to which he quickly responded by kicking me from his group chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is where it ended, I wouldn&apos;t have made a blog post. But oh boy it gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 3: Thinking He&apos;s In The Right?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, the rollercoaster has just begun. After I had left him behind, he started talking in another group chat about the situation, and he said that he won&apos;t apologize for what he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/i-have-no-plan-on-apologizing.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying that he has &amp;quot;no plan on apologizing for what I said that caused all of that to happen&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on in the conversation, he changes everything about his profile to just question marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/question-marks.png&quot; alt=&quot;???&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then he doubles down on this, changing his profile to all red and setting his status to &quot;Not apologizing as I believe I am not in the wrong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&quot;red-profile&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/i-believe-i-am-not-in-the-wrong.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of Matheus&apos; profile, with his status saying &amp;quot;Not apologizing as I believe I am not in the wrong.&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His about me also says &quot;Things are not how they seem&quot; in morse code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/things-are-not-how-they-seem.png&quot; alt=&quot;A translated version of his about me&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He literally blackmailed and threatened me for a secret and now he&apos;s saying he&apos;s not in the wrong and that &quot;things are not how they seem&quot;? The delusion is insane!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 4: The Confrontation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of this, Charlie decided to DM Matheus confronting him about what he did. The first thing Charlie asked was &quot;Why did you blackmail? That is not okay in the slightest.&quot;, and Matheus responded with &quot;For me it is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/blackmail-is-okay-for-me.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying that for him blackmail is okay&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excuse me?? How can you be so delusional that you think blackmailing and threatening someone is okay??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then doubles down, saying that he &quot;can blackmail [his] own best friend so idgaf about blackmailing people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/i-can-blackmail-my-own-best-friend.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying that he can blackmail his own best friend so he doesn&apos;t care about blackmail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, Charlie asks him why he thinks blackmail is okay, and he reiterates the point that he&apos;s a narcissist (as if that makes it okay somehow?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/im-a-narcissist-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying that he&apos;s a narcissist so &amp;quot;most things [he] does [he] does to benefit [himself]&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie continues, saying that he knew I was crying and he continued, and asks what part of that is normal to do. Matheus responds with &quot;everything?&quot;, as if everything he did was just something everyone else does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/you-saw-him-cry-and-you-continued.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying that everything he did was normal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this riviting response, Charlie told him that his reputation was on the line. He responds by saying that it &quot;did nothing to his reputation.&quot; Charlie then responds by showing him a screenshot of one of his messages about him removing everyone from his group chat and that he doesn&apos;t want to tell anyone what happened because it will &quot;ruin his image.&quot; He then responds by saying that he can just say that he &quot;didn&apos;t do that&quot; and that &quot;it is all lies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&quot;its-all-lies&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/i-can-just-say-its-all-lies.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying that he can just say that it&apos;s all lies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie then tells him that I wanted to keep what happened private (which is true), and asking him why he blackmailed and bullied me for it, and asking for the reason if any. He responds by saying that he was simply &quot;curious af&quot; and that he &quot;[won&apos;t] stop at any point,&quot; along with asking Charlie &quot;since when [was him not] hating on YAB ?! Counts blackmail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/i-was-curious-af.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying that he was curious&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, he then promptly blocks Charlie. That&apos;s the end of the confrontation. But we&apos;re only getting started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 5: Holding Graphify Hostage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the confrontation, Matheus starts a new plan. This plan involves my main YouTube channel and project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/@GraphifyStatistics&quot;&gt;Graphify&lt;/a&gt;. But first, let me give you a little bit of context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same day this happened, Graphify&apos;s second channel Graphify+ was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GraphifyStudios/status/1770782181180182946&quot;&gt;terminated from YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. This caused me to lose access to the main channel, Graphify, but everyone else who had permission still had access to the channel, including Matheus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what did Matheus do? He decides to keep my channel hostage. Literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/toast-is-stupid-if-he-thinks-ill-let-him-have-access-to-graphify.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying that I&apos;m &amp;quot;stupid if [I] think [he&apos;ll] let [me] have access to the Graphify account&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, now he&apos;s putting Graphify on the line all for this stupid secret! He then doubles down by demoting everyone to editor role so they couldn&apos;t remove him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/im-the-only-one-with-manager-now.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying that he&apos;s the only one with manager now&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, he decides out of the kindness of his own heart to give everyone their permissions back and set himself to viewer. But does he apologize? Still no. He says he&apos;s only doing it because of &quot;pressure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/bro-finally-became-a-good-person.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying that he gave everyone back their permissions, and also how he still won&apos;t apologize&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 6: He Gives Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of this chaos, he finally realizes that he was in the wrong. But of course it&apos;s Matheus, he&apos;s not gonna fully admit to his wrongdoings, he&apos;s just gonna say it was all a character he was portraying!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/it-was-all-a-character.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus saying that it was all a character&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, Matheus, if you&apos;re reading this, your apology has not been accepted. You say this everytime, when are you actually going to admit you&apos;re wrong and actually change as a person? I guess I&apos;ll have to wait another 7 decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 7: Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Matheus likes to blackmail and threaten people just because he&apos;s &quot;curious&quot; of something, and will go to great lengths to prove that he&apos;s in the right and that he did nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading all the way through! This took a long time to make, and to witness first-hand as the victim. Again, special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/@Stats100&quot;&gt;Galvin/Stats100&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/charlieashfordd&quot;&gt;Charlie from the MrBeast Stats crew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/@GNZGUY&quot;&gt;GNZGUY&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/@DarioCounts&quot;&gt;Dario&lt;/a&gt; for helping me get the evidence for this. And to everyone else who supported me during my mental breakdown, and who still supported me even after Matheus&apos; delusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see the beginning of this whole debacle, check out my new website &lt;a href=&quot;https://matheus.toasted.dev&quot;&gt;matheus.toasted.dev&lt;/a&gt;, which is an archive of his group chat that shows all of the messages on the day of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for those curious, yes I did block him again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/dear-matheus/blocked.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot showing that I blocked Matheus&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not like he blocked me first, but oh well, all is well that ends well. Except this time it didn&apos;t end well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/dear-matheus&quot;&gt;a part 2 of this now&lt;/a&gt;, with even worse things than what I described here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UPDATE (12/20/2023)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/i-cant-block-matheus/blocked-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing that I have blocked Mathues&apos; main account&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/i-cant-block-matheus/blocked-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing that I have blocked Mathues&apos; alt account&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Original&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of my friends keep asking me to &quot;just block Matheus&quot; everytime he annoys me. But really, I can&apos;t. It&apos;s impossible for me to &quot;just block him&quot;. Now you may be asking, &quot;why?&quot;, and that&apos;s why I made this blog post, to finally put this question to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who is &quot;Matheus&quot;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matheusify&lt;/strong&gt; (better known as &lt;strong&gt;Matheus&lt;/strong&gt;) is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/@Matheusify&quot;&gt;YouTube creator&lt;/a&gt; focused on making analytical content, better known as &quot;statistics content&quot;. He&apos;s also well known for his annoying behaviour, especially on Discord. He&apos;s constantly harassing statistics creators, just like myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is Matheus &quot;annoying&quot;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated above, he constantly harasses statistics creators, especially myself. He always messages me asking me things. And when I don&apos;t respond, he spams me until I do. He also constantly asks me to do things, may it be changing one element in my stream or website, to &lt;strong&gt;completely changing my identity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A case study: &quot;Amy&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Amy&quot; (mostly displayed as &quot;amy :3&quot;) was my old transgender identity. Yes, I used to be transgender. I&apos;ve since escaped, but I almost fell back into the trap multiple times, and one of the main factors is Matheus. When I was first thinking of being transgender, he kept asking me to just do it. He was very impatient. He wanted to see it happen right away, and so I did. Now I really regret listening to him, but can you really blame me when these are the messages he&apos;s sending you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/i-cant-block-matheus/amy-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus asking me to change my profile picture&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/i-cant-block-matheus/amy-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus asking me to change my username&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/i-cant-block-matheus/amy-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus asking me if I will change my profile picture and username&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/i-cant-block-matheus/amy-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus convincing me to keep going&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, those messages were sent in a timeframe of around &lt;strong&gt;10 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;. And yet, after all this, he still said that he didn&apos;t like my &quot;Amy&quot; identity. Then why did you keep asking me to do it in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Another case study: The &quot;Former Trans&quot; incident&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I made a Discord server for all my friends to hang out in. It was meant to be a good place for me to talk to all my friends in a touch of a button. But because Matheus is Matheus, he asked (and of course, pleaded for) me to give him admin on the server. And let&apos;s just say that I regret doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was sleeping on a Thursday, dreaming about classes finally ending, Matheus decided to strike a nerve against my best friend TERA, who was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;allegedly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; transgender, but has since escaped the rabbit hole and is now very against transgenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Matheus gives TERA a &quot;Former Trans&quot; role for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/i-cant-block-matheus/former-trans-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The member list of my friends server, showing TERA having the &amp;quot;Former Trans&amp;quot; role&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then starts trying to &quot;expose&quot; TERA for &quot;being trans&quot; (again, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;allegedly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;). TERA told him to stop because it was very annoying and unnecessary and according to him isn&apos;t true, but he continues. His friend, Lean, tries to defend TERA and gets very pissed at him because of what he&apos;s saying. TERA tells Lean to stop because Matheus is just an attention seeker (which, if you can&apos;t tell from the previous examples, is very true), to which Matheus times out both TERA and Lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/i-cant-block-matheus/former-trans-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot from TERA, showing that he was timed out for 7 days&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, Matheus quickly deletes all the messages they sent regarding the situation (which according to TERA, probably out of fear of getting banned), and then he locks the general chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/i-cant-block-matheus/former-trans-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot from TERA, showing that the general chat was locked&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just to remind you, this all happened while I was asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why can&apos;t I just block Matheus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part that I&apos;ve been waiting to talk about. After all of that proof, you may be wondering to yourself, &quot;if he&apos;s this annoying, why can&apos;t you just block him?&quot;, and you bring a fair point. I could just hit the &quot;Block&quot; button and move on with my life, &lt;strong&gt;but I can&apos;t&lt;/strong&gt;. He physically does not let me move on, and here&apos;s how he does it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. He pleads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before I hit the &quot;Block&quot; button, he always just begs to not be blocked, as if me blocking him will just magically make him die on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. He harasses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I do hit the &quot;Block&quot; button, he goes the extra mile to try to contact me. He will go to hell and back just to ask for me to unblock him. He usually does this by asking one (or even many) of my friends to message me telling me that I should unblock him. Here&apos;s just some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/i-cant-block-matheus/pleading-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus asking my friend GNZ to message me asking for me to unblock him&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/i-cant-block-matheus/pleading-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus asking my best friend TERA to message me asking for me to unblock him&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/i-cant-block-matheus/pleading-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus asking my friend GNZ to message me saying that he&apos;s sorry for making a joke about leaking my email&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;@assets/i-cant-block-matheus/pleading-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Matheus asking my friend GNZ to message me about resolving our &amp;quot;beef&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s way more, but if I were to list them all here, it would take up the entire blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. He wins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the longest step, but after jumping through all those hoops, he finally convinces me to unblock him, and then I unblock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. He repeats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then he repeats these steps everytime I block him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matheus always annoys and harasses me and other creators in the statistics community about everything. And even if we try to block Matheus, he will find ways to beg and convince us to unblock him. It&apos;s a never-ending cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

I&apos;ve wanted a place to dump my developer thoughts into, and this is the perfect time to make a blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who am I?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is ToastedToast. I&apos;m a developer making things for the web and Discord. I&apos;ve had a fun programming journey. From making &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TCATech/LegacyPainBot&quot;&gt;terrible Discord bots&lt;/a&gt;, to making &lt;a href=&quot;https://yabcounts.com&quot;&gt;advanced full-stack websites&lt;/a&gt;, my development journey has been wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What stack is this built on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole website was built using &lt;a href=&quot;https://astro.build&quot;&gt;Astro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
