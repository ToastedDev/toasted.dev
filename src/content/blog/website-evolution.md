title: The Evolution of My Website
description: Somehow this silly little website that was meant to just describe who I am has gone through a lot.

In the past few days, I've been digging through my old GitHub projects and accidentally stumbled across my old websites. So I decided to make a little post about it just so I can roast my past self for making bad things. From the light mode messes to the slightly more orange experiences, let's begin this trip down memory lane!

## November 2022 (toastify.tk v1)

And this is where the toast stuff starts to appear. Maybe I'll talk about the story of how that came to be one day.

This design was awful though, who thought a yellow gradient was a good idea? And especially fading to black to the bottom right? Hey, at least he felt proud of his favorite color though (for better or for worse).

## March 2023 (toastify.tk v2)

Now this was way better. The gradient is much more calming, stuff's smaller so you actually have space to breathe, and overall it's just pretty clean.

## December 17th, 2023 (toasted.dev v1)

One day I decided "you know what, I think I'm gonna make a new website." So, I quickly pulled up an Astro template and made this abomination.

Whoever trusted this guy with [opinions about Matheus](/blog/i-cant-block-matheus) should have been deeply questioned about their mental health (/s), because this was awful. I'm glad we've moved past this era.

## December 20th, 2023 until now (toasted.dev v2)

And here is where the journey ends, with a more dark and pleasant experience. There's other versions of this homepage, but I'm not gonna list all of them because it's gonna take you like another year and a half to read this entire thing.

I've honestly thought about redesigning my website before, but honestly this is just so good and orange that I don't feel like it needs it.
